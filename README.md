# Signal processing examples

Examples are based on this [lectures](https://github.com/hukenovs/dsp-theory?tab=readme-ov-file)

## Spectrum display

Shows real-time fourrier transformed signal

```bash
python ./audio_spectrum.py
```

## Sound direction

Filters in sound band of 2730 Hz (I have a sound source with this frequency) and shows its direction.

```bash
python ./sound_direction.py
```
